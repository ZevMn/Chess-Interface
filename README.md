# Chess Interface - MSc Computing Project

This repository contains a C++ implementation of a chess interface developed as part of my coursework for the MSc Computing program at Imperial College London. The project includes the core logic for a chess game along with an interactive interface for playing chess.

## Features

- **Chess Game Logic**: Implements the rules of chess, handling moves, checking for checkmate and stalemate.
- **Move Validation**: Ensures that all moves are legal before they are made.

## Files

- `ChessGame.cpp` and `ChessGame.h`: Contains the core game logic for managing the chess game, including rules and move validation.
- `ChessMain.cpp`: The entry point for the chess application. Used for testing and debugging purposes.
- `ChessPiece.cpp` and `ChessPiece.h`: Defines the chess pieces and their behavior.
- `Enums.h`: Defines the enumerations used throughout the project (e.g., piece types, player colors).
- `chess`: The executable for running the chess interface.
- `makefile`: Contains build instructions for compiling and linking the project.
